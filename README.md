Color Detection Project

Overview
This Python project aims to detect and identify colors within an image using OpenCV and pandas libraries. It provides a graphical interface that allows users to click on any pixel within the displayed image to determine the corresponding color name.

Features
Reads an image file and displays it with OpenCV.
Converts the image to a smaller size for better display.
Utilizes a CSV file (colors.csv) containing color information to identify and display the color name.
Implements a mouse-click event to capture the color of the clicked pixel.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
pandas (pandas)
Steps
Clone the repository or download the project files.

Install required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python pandas
Place your desired image file in the project directory.

Ensure the colors.csv file (containing color information) is available in the project folder.

Usage
Run the Python script color_detection.py.

The script will display the chosen image. Click on any pixel within the image to detect and print the corresponding color name in the console.

Examples
Include screenshots or code snippets demonstrating how to run the script and perform color detection on different images.

Contributing
Feel free to contribute by enhancing the color detection algorithm, optimizing code, or improving user interaction. Fork the repository, make changes, and create a pull request.
