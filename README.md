# Color Detection Project

## Overview
This Python project aims to detect and identify colors within an image using OpenCV and pandas libraries. It provides a graphical interface that allows users to click on any pixel within the displayed image to determine the corresponding color name.

## Features
- Reads and displays images using OpenCV.
- Converts images for optimal display.
- Utilizes a CSV file for color identification.
- Implements a mouse-click event for color detection.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 
- pandas

### Steps
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python pandas
    ```
3. Place image files in the designated directory.
4. Ensure colors.csv is in the project folder.

## Usage 
- Run the Python script color_detection.py.
- The script will display the chosen image using OpenCV.
- Click on any pixel within the image to detect and print the corresponding color name in the console.
